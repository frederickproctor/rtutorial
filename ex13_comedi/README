Comedi provides kernel module device drivers for a variety of I/O
boards. Comedilib is the convenient Linux application programming
interface to the device drivers. KComedilib gives the same convenient
programming interface to RTAI kernel modules. KComedilib is provided
as part of Comedi.

To install Comedi, get the latest CVS snapshot anonymously:

cd /usr/local
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.comedi.org:/cvs/comedi co comedi
cd comedi
./autogen.sh
./configure && make && sudo make install
sudo depmod -a

Now you'll have the base comedi kernel module 'comedi.ko', all the
Comedi device drivers, and the kcomedilib kernel module
'kcomedilib.ko' in the usual place, /lib/modules/XXX/comedi.

You'll want to get KComedi to get the configuration and debugging
utilities. Get it via CVS similarly: 

cd /usr/local
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.comedi.org:/cvs/comedi co comedilib
cd comedilib
./autogen.sh
./configure && make && sudo make install

The 'comedi_config' utility you'll need for setting up the parameters
for the device drivers you'll use is installed in the /usr/local/sbin/
directory. Add this to your path.

No modules are built in Comedilib, so no need to run 'depmod'. 

There is a board information utility 'board_info' in the
comedilib/demo directory. Build that: 

cd comedilib/demo
make

There is no install for this, so copy this to a well-known place,
probably the /usr/local/sbin/ directory where 'comedi_config' is
located:

sudo cp board_info /usr/local/sbin
